##  COVID-19 2020-04-02 report

If you are looking for a "human browsable" version of the data, you can find it [there](https://madlag.github.io/coronavirus_study/).

This repository contains some code and data archived from ECDC to study the spread of coronavirus, 
to make some basic observations about the trajectories of countries compared to each others, and so
to make some rough estimations on the evolution of the pandemic in each country.

All the graphs that are found here are created from _real_ data, no model is used. It's up to you to make
your mind and to make sensible comparisons between countries to draw some conclusions about what's next : 
from what happened in March 2020, it looks like that a lot of countries follow similar trajectories.
